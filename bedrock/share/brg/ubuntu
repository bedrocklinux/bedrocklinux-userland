### support functions for brg for Debian-based distros

# Note that many functions from here may be sourced and used by other,
# Debian-based distros.  Best to keep things broken up into individual
# functions to other distros can pick-and-choose what is applicable.

# source debian
. /home/paradigm/.src/brg/debian

# override with ubuntu-specific things

# ubuntu has different default mirror than debian
check_mirror() {
	if [ -z "$mirror" ]
	then
		mirror="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
	fi
}

# ubuntu has different repository mirrors than debian
config_apt() {
	echo "brg: Configuring apt"
	mkdir -p "$output/etc/apt/"
	(
		echo "deb $mirror $release main"
		echo "deb $mirror ${release}-security main"
	) > "$output/etc/apt/sources.list"
	mount_chroot "$output" apt-get -y update
	check "could not setup apt"
}

# ubuntu handles locale differently from Debian

	echo "brg: Applying Bedrock Linux Tweaks"
	# fixes statoverride errors

	# ensure client uses /proc/mounts instead of mtab
