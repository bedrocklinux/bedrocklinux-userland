#
# At least one stratum should provide an Olson database file at
#
#     /usr/share/zoneinfo/<timezone>

[init]
#
# Bedrock Linux provides its own init which sets up Bedrock subsystems then
# hands control over to a user-selected init provided by some stratum.
#

# Number of seconds to wait for an init to be input before automatically
# selecting the default value (if a valid default value is set).
#

#
#     default = <stratum>:<path>
#
# For example, to use void's /sbin/init, use:
#
#     default = void:/sbin/init
#
default =

#
# A comma separated list of local file paths which may provide an init.  The
# Bedrock init menu will list every available one from every (unignored)
# stratum.

[global]
#
# Bedrock Linux categorizes every file path on the system as either:
#
# - Local to a given stratum.  Multiple instances of such files are needed to
# avoid conflicts between the strata.
# - Global across all strata.  There is only one instance of such a file
# irrelevant of the number of strata.
#
# For example: both Debian and Ubuntu have package managers that read
# /etc/apt/sources.list, and each needs to see something different there.
# Thus, the /etc/apt/sources.list file path should be local to each stratum.
# However, all processes should see the same contents in /home, and thus /home
# is global.
#
# By default, all files are local.  The following settings are used to indicate
# which files should be global.  Different contexts require different systems
# for marking a file path as global.
#

#
# A list of directories which should be global.  If something is
# mounted into one of these directories, that new mount point
# is also global.
#
share = /boot, /dev, /home, /lib/modules, /media, /mnt, /proc, /root, /run, /sys, /tmp

#
# Another list of directories which should be global.  Anything mounted in them
# is local by default.  These are primarily used to avoid recursion in nested
# cases.  Given that nesting is expected, be careful with order.
#
bind = /bedrock, /bedrock/cross, /bedrock/run, /bedrock/strata/bedrock

#
# A list of files and directories within /etc which should be global.  /etc
# must be treated specially, as the techniques used for share and bind do not
# work for files in it.
#

# Enforce various symlinks are in place at local paths.  This is applied at
# stratum enable/repair time.
#
# Keys are local paths, values are symlink contents.
#
# The symlink contents must be absolute paths.
#

#
# Some package managers attempt to update this.  They become upset if it is
# created between an unlink() and symlink(), making it unsuitable for
# [etc-symlinks] below.
#
# Different distros use slightly different values here that are all effectively
# the same.  Rather than attempt to fight distros in this regard, Bedrock has
# hard-coded internal support for multiple valid values here and may not
# respect changes to this field.

# In general, system software such as Bedrock should not manipulate /usr/local.
# Bedrock should favor configuring /etc files instead.
#
# However, dbus's dbus-daemon-launch-helper seems to ignore /etc/dbus-1/
# configuration extending the search path.  See
# https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92458 for a discussion on the
# matter.  For example:
#
# > Note that d-d-l-h only reads .service files from standard hard-coded paths,
# > not from any additional paths that you might have configured
#
# Since /usr/local/share/dbus is included in the hard-coded paths, is not used
# by most package managers, and is rarely used by end-users, it's the cleanest
# option available to teach dbus about /bedrock/cross.

[etc-inject]

# local configuration.  Typically these configuration files are in /etc.
#
# Bedrock ensures that, should certain files exist in /etc, they will include
# content specified at another file path.  If the desired content is not found
# in the file it is automatically appended to the end.
#
# The keys are file paths relative to /etc, and the values are paths to files
# whose content must be included if the key's file exists in /etc.
#
# If you alter either the key/values in this section, or the actual content of
# the values, run `brl apply` to apply the change.  Do this before rebooting
# to ensure any old content is removed.

[env-vars]
#
# Many programs search environment variables consisting of a colon-separated
# list of directories.  We can use these to teach these programs about
# cross-stratum content.
#
# Generally, the fields fall into three categories, which should be in the
# following order:
#
# - The file must come from a specific stratum.
#     - For example, `reboot` should be provided by the stratum providing the
#     current init.
#     - Typically, these are provided by `/bedrock/cross/pin/[...]`.
# - The file must come from the local stratum.
#     - Bedrock Linux assumes strata are self-sufficient in terms of hard
#     dependencies.  Thus, if something has a hard dependency on a given file
#     that file *must* be available locally.
#     - For example, if a given distro's `/bin/sh` is provided by bash, that
#     distro's scripts may use bash-isms, and thus another distro's `/bin/sh`
#     may be unsuitable.
#     - Typically these values are the traditional values of the given
#     environment variable.
# - The file may come from any stratum.
#     - If the above two categories don't apply, we know the program isn't
#     picky about the specific version of the given file, and thus any distro
#     may provide it.
#     - Typically, these are provided by `/bedrock/cross/[...]`.

[restriction]
#
# Some programs become confused upon discovering software from other distros.
# To avoid this, Bedrock can restrict such software to its own stratum (and
# global paths) by removing cross paths from various environment variables.
#
# This is primarily needed for software which discovers dependencies in
# preparation for compiling, such as Arch Linux's makepkg.  However, it may be
# useful for other programs as well.
#
# This only affects processes which are run through `strat` or /bedrock/cross.
# To ensure unwrapped calls are run through cross, configure pin entries under
# [cross-bin].
#
# List any commands you would like restricted here.
#
restrict = apt-key, debuild, dpkg-buildpackage, gdb, git, makepkg, rpmbuild

[cross]
#
# Bedrock Linux mounts a virtual filesystem at
#
#     /bedrock/cross
#
# which provides an alternative view of various files from the enabled strata.
# This view is used for cross-stratum coordination.
#
# For the [cross-*] sections below, the keys represent file paths appended to
# /bedrock/cross, and the values are a list of files or directories to be
# searched for contents for the given file path.  For example,
#
#     man = /usr/local/share/man, /usr/share/man
#
# indicates that /bedrock/cross/man should be populated with the contents of
# the /usr/local/share/man and /usr/share/man directories of all of the enabled
# strata.
#
# The paths used for values may be prefixed by "<stratum>:" indicating the
# given file/directory should only be considered from a specific stratum.  For
# example,
#
#     pin/bin/firefox = arch:/usr/bin/firefox, void:/usr/bin/firefox
#
# Indicates a file at /bedrock/cross/pin/bin/firefox should be provided by
# arch if available, or if not then void; otherwise, the file should not exist.
#

#
# If a value does not have a stratum prefixed, it may be provided by any
# stratum that has the file.  If multiple do, the values in "priority" below
# indicate which should be given priority.  Any enabled strata left unspecified
# are implicitly appended at the end in an unspecified order.  For example,
#
#     priority = gentoo, debian
#
# indicates that for the `man` example above, if gentoo provides the given man
# page, gentoo's version should be provided.  Otherwise, if debian does, then
# debian's should be provided.  Otherwise, any stratum that provides the man
# page may provide it.

# here, `brl fetch` will attempt to select a mirror from those it finds for the
# given distribution.

# Rather than configuring each of these separately, the base URL can be added
