# systemd appears to automatically share all preexisting mount points at boot.
# Moreover, this functionality appears to be hard-coded with no configuration
# option to disable it.
#
# This attempts to re-apply Bedrock's desired mount point settings after
# systemd has finished changing them.
#
# Additonally it fixes LVM devices.
