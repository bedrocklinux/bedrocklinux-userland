brc ("BedRock local Context")
======================

brc provides the ability to run commands in strata, properly handling
local-context switches.

Usage
-----

To use (after it is properly configured), run:

    brc <stratum-name> <command-to-run>

Configuration
-------------

If there exists a root-owned, only-root-writable file at

    /bedrock/run/enabled_strata/<stratum-name>

brc will allow users to run software from that stratum, switching out local
context files accordingly.  If this file does not exist or is writable by
anyone other than root, brc will refuse to operate.  Be sure the stratum's files
exist at /bedrock/strata/<stratum-name> and that brs has set it up
(check bri -s <stratum-name>).  This should "just work" on a properly setup
Bedrock Linux system.

Installation
------------

Bedrock Linux should be distributed with a script which handles installation,
but just in case:

The dependencies are:

- libcap (can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/)
- libbedrock (should be distributed with this)

To compile, run

    make

To install into installdir, run

    make prefix=<installdir> install

Then proceed to use "setcap" to set the "cap_sys_chroot=ep" capability on the
installed brc executable.

To clean up, like usual:

    make uninstall

And finally, to remove it, run:

    make prefix=<installdir> uninstall
