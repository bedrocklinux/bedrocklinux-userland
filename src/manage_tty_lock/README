`unlock` as the first argument.  The second argument can be utilized to specify
which terminal to lock/unlock; if it is left unset, the current terminal is
utilized.

Example, locking /dev/pts/1:

	manage_stty_lock lock /dev/pts/1

Example, unlocking the current terminal:

	Example: manage_stty_lock unlock
